## Step by step instructions:

1. Select **Sites** from the left navigation pane and click **Add new site**.
2. Give your exhibit a title and select a theme for your exhibit from the **Theme** tab.
3. Select **Pages** from the left navigation pane. You will see that Omeka has created a default Welcome page for you. You can either delete this page (by clicking on the **trash can icon** and start from scratch by selecting **Add new page**, or you can edit the content on the default Welcome page by clicking on the page title.

### Adding Content Blocks
- Add media or text to your exhibit by using content blocks.
- From the **Add new block** window on the right, choose either **HTML** (for text), **Media Embed** (for one or more archival items), or **Item Showcase** (for multiple archival items displayed side by side).
- Add media to the content block by clicking on **Add Attachment** and selecting the archival item you wish to use from the pane on the right. You can **Filter** the items by searching for your specific **Item Set**. 
- Once you've attached your media you can edit the image size (Thumbnail), layout (Alignment), and choose whether or not to display the item's title from the metadata (Show attachment title).
- To save your layout click **Save** in the top right corner.
- To see what your exhibit looks like from the public side select **View**.
- To return to the backend to make additional edits select **Edit**.

### Adding Multiple Pages

- Next, you will populate your selected metadata fields. It will be up to you to decide which fields to include based on the nature of your research project or digital exhibit. But it is recommended that you include *at least* **Title**, **Type**, **Identifier**, and **Rights**.
- Once you've added all of the metadata select **Add** in the top right corner.

### Media
- Once you've saved your metadata by clicking **Add** in the top right corner it is time to upload your digital asset.
- Click on the **Media** tab and select **Upload** from the pane on the right.
- Click on **Choose file**, locate your file, and select **Add** in the top right corner. 
- Now you have uploaded both the metadata and the media for your digital asset.


3. The final step is to assign this item to your **Item Set**. To do this click on the **Item Set** tab at the top and select the desired Item Set from the pane on the right.

*n.b. If you are still working on the metadata for your item, or are waiting for information about permissions and rights, you can keep the item private by selecting the **eye icon** in the top right corner. When you are ready to make the item public, simply click on the eye again and you will no longer see a strike through the icon. This means the item can be viewed publicly.*

Once you've added a few Items to your Item Set you are ready to proceed to [Step 3](step3): Building a Digital Exhibit.
