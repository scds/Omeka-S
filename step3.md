## Step by step instructions:

- Select **Sites** from the left navigation pane and click **Add new site**.
- Give your exhibit a title and select a theme for your exhibit from the **Theme** tab.
- Select **Pages** from the left navigation pane. You will see that Omeka has created a default Welcome page for you. You can either delete this page (by clicking on the **trash can icon**) and start from scratch by selecting **Add new page**, or you can edit the content on the default Welcome page by clicking on the page title.

### Adding Content Blocks
- Add media or text to your exhibit by using content blocks.
- From the **Add new block** window on the right, choose either **HTML** (for text), **Media Embed** (for one or more archival items), or **Item Showcase** (for multiple archival items displayed side by side).
- Add media to the content block by clicking on **Add Attachment** and selecting the archival item you wish to use from the pane on the right. You can **Filter** the items by searching for your specific **Item Set**. 
- Once you've attached your media you can edit the image size (Thumbnail), layout (Alignment), and choose whether or not to display the item's title from the metadata (Show attachment title).
- To save your layout click **Save** in the top right corner.
- To see what your exhibit looks like from the public side select **View**.
- To return to the backend to make additional edits select **Edit**.

### Adding Multiple Pages

- Select **Pages** from the left navigation pane.
- Here you will see all of the pages in your Omeka Site. You can add a new page by clicking on **Add new page** in the top right corner. 
- Give your new page a title and select **Add to Navigation** if you want this page to be accessible from your exhibit's navigation menu. 
- Select **Add** in the top right corner and now you have another page in your digital exhibit. 
- You can add content and media to this page by following the instructions listed above.
