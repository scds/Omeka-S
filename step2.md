## Step by step instructions

1. From within your Item Set click on **View items** and select **Add new item** in the top right corner.
2. To add an item in Omeka you need to have **a) the metadata** and **b) the media** ( or the digital asset i.e., a high resolution scan or photograph of the item)
### Metadata
- First select a **Resource template**. Use **BaseResource**.
- Then select a **Class** depending on the type of item your ar uploading (e.g., dataset, still image, physical object).
- Next you will populate your selected metadata fields. It will be up to you to decide which fields to include, based on the nature of your research project or digital exhibit. But we recommend to include *at least* **Title**, **Type**, **Identifier**, and **Rights**.
- Once you've added all of the metadata select **Add** in the top right corner.
### Media


Once you've added a few Items to your Item Set you are ready to proceed to [Step 3](step3): Building a Digital Exhibit.
