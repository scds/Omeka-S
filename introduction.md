## Get the software
This hands-on workshop uses [**Tableau**](https://www.tableau.com/), a software application for data visualization. We ask that you download Tableau in advance of the workshop to be able to participate in it to the fullest extent.

You have three options for downloading Tableau:
1. [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/) (limited version)
2. A 14-day trial of [Tableau Desktop](https://www.tableau.com/products/trial)
3. A 1-year instructor or student license for [Tableau Desktop for academic purposes](https://www.tableau.com/academic/teaching) 

The three options will be discussed further during the workshop; for now, we recommend Tableau Public or the 14-day trial of Tableau Desktop. Please contact the [Sherman Centre](mailto:scds@mcmaster.ca) if you have any difficulties downloading or opening the software.
