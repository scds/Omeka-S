## Preparation

### 1. View Examples
One of the best ways to know if Omeka is the right platform for you is to view examples of projects. Here are a few examples to get you started:
* [https://exhibit.utas.edu.au/ ]
* [https://omeka.org/s/directory/]

### 2. Digitize Assets
For tips on the digitization process, see the video [Digitization for Digital Scholarship](https://echo360.ca/media/64eab494-dc95-4b06-8189-4162f5794cb7/public) created by our digitization services manager, Krista Jamieson.

### 3. Know the Rights
It is important that you know the rights for the material you plan to use (whether you are doing the digitization yourself or using items from an existing digital collection). Remember that in building an Omeka exhibit you are creating something that is public-facing, so it is your responsibility to ensure that you have the proper permissions to use these digitized archival items.

*If you are working with a collection that is already digitized, this collection MAY be licensed in such a way that allows you to use the material with attribution. In a case where you are digitizing the content yourself, you will have to get permission to use the content for your Omeka site. Often this permission comes from the owner of the content, and not the archive itself, but archivists can certainly help you navigate the process of obtaining permissions.*

Once you've completed these introductory steps navigate to the [The Omeka Sandbox](omekasandbox) setup page.
